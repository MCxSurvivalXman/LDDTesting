# LDDTesting
LDD parts ported from Unity

I am slowly converting most of the new parts from the Unity LEGO collection into LDD. Parts will be located here, the Duplo parts are fully functional with each other, but don't current combine with normal system brick. Included is also the group picture for the Duplo parts
